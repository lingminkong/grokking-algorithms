## Big O notation

Big O notation measures how fast an algorithm runs.

- Algorithm running times grow at different speed.
- Algorithm speed isn't measured in seconds, but in growth of the number of operations.
- Big O notation talks about how quickly the run time of an algorithm increases as the size of input increases.
- Big O establishes a worst-case run time.
- O(log n) is faster than O(n), and it gets a lot faster as the number of items you're searching grows
